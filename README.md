Current Version: 1.1.1
Last Updated: 07/28/2015

#Command-Line Usage Examples

#Notes:

*If a .emt file already exists for a selected zone, new entries will be merged into the file, skipping any duplicates
*The format line naming each field will be added to the top of .emt files, for human consumption.
*I have run into no troubles myself, but I recommended you have a backup of your EverQuest directory before performing large batch conversions.
