  * If a .emt file already exists for a selected zone, new entries will be merged into the file, skipping any duplicates
  
  * The format line naming each field will be added to the top of .emt files, for human consumption.
  
  * I have run into no troubles myself, but I recommended you have a backup of your EverQuest directory before performing large batch conversions.
