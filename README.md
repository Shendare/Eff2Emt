#EQ Eff2Emt Converter
EverQuest Eff2Emt Zone Sounds Converter (Command Line)

Current Version: 1.1.1
Last Updated: 07/28/2015

GUI Version: https://github.com/Shendare/Eff2EmtGUI

#Command-Line Usage Examples

* Eff2Emt akheva_sounds.eff
* Eff2Emt firiona
* Eff2Emt freport?
* Eff2Emt felwith*
* Eff2Emt *
* Eff2Emt C:\Games\EQTitanium\soldung*

#Notes:

* If a .emt file already exists for a selected zone, new entries will be merged into the file, skipping any duplicates
* The format line naming each field will be added to the top of .emt files, for human consumption.
* I have run into no troubles myself, but I recommended you have a backup of your EverQuest directory before performing large batch conversions.
